The module "gabor_demo.py" can be used to find suitable values for the
Gabor-filters.

Since the latest Anaconda-distribution of Python has some problems with
Tkinter, you can either

    i) bypass those problems, by implementing the changes suggested below. Or
    ii) alternatively, you can start with the parameter values that I used for my own solution of the problem:
        (lambda_factor=2, nstds=2, numPts=51, psi=np.pi/2, gamma=0.5)

Solving the Tkinter-Problems in Anaconda
----------------------------------------

In the module "gabor_demo.py" I make use of tkinter, through calling the
submodule "misc" in the package "scikit-sound". (The only reason I do is is
because the package "easygui" did not run on OSX, because of a bug in the
Tkinter-implementation on Mac.)

Now the current version of Anaconda is built using Tcl 8.6.8, but the
init-files say that version 8.6.9 is required. Since there is no easy way to
upgrade the installation, you can fix the problem by changing two ini-files.
So far I have seen no negative side-effects.

Specifically, change
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\tcl\tcl8.6\init.tcl
Line 19
to
    package require -exact Tcl 8.6.8

and in
C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\tcl\tk8.6\tk.tcl
change Line 14 to
    package require -exact Tk  8.6.8

Alternatively, change the file-selection in
gabor_demo.py
such that you don't use Tkinter (or any programs that depend on it).
