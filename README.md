# CSSS ETHZ Projects
ci_sim: Simple cochlear implant simulation in python using FFT

vest_impl: Simulation of a Vestibular Implant in Python

# Requirements
Install requirements using pip. You have to do it this way because there is a fix applied to the scikit-kinematics library which hasn't been pushed upstream yet. Otherwise the code WILL FAIL.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Run

`cd SRCDIR`
`python main.py`
